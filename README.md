# Example of libsodium in Python
The scripts in this repo show how to:
* generate a public and secret key
* encrypt a sealed box via a public key
* decrypt a sealed box via a secret key

For portability, all keys and encrypted data are stored in base64.

## Required modules
* [PyNaCl](https://github.com/pyca/pynacl)

## Examples in other languages
See the [libsodium_examples](https://github.com/users/tpronk/projects/1) project.
